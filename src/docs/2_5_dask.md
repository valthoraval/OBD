# Dask on Kubernetes

In this class, we focus on getting a [Dask](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/) cluster running in Kubernetes, which we will then use in the [Dask project](https://supaerodatascience.github.io/OBD/2_6_project.html). Dask is a parallel computing library in Python which integrates well with machine learning tools like scikit-learn.

Students will use GCP for this class. Be sure to stop your cluster after class to conserve GCP credits.
